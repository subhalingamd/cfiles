The famous Queen (Rosalie Exeter Atkins)'s crown journey has now stepped into our Itoville. 
It was placed in the city Museum for the public from 08:00 to 18:00.


However, it was destroyed without any clue, at around 17:00 in front of the guards' eyes and the whole crowd witnessed the disappearing of the crown.

The shocked guards acted fast and closed all exits and cleared the people from 2nd floor to the 1st floor. 
A word was sent to the head of museum who came saw the crown's dust between the glass box. They also completely checked them for any weapons and fortunately they couldn't find any thing.

A word was sent to the new Queen and to the local police station.

Mr Nixon, a Junior Detective, who was one among the crowd, asked the guards whether he can help them? 


And the case has come to us for a solution...
