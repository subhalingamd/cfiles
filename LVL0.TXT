Hi <name> Welcome to Itoville!

I'm Cameron Nicholson and I'll be glad to assist you!

Before we start, let me tell you something about this city.
Itoville is a small city, infamous for it's crime scenes!
24 detectives have quit in the last 3 months...

Okay, leave that!


Let's start this game after a small tutorial!

Well, this game is very simple!

You will be asked to solve a case in each level.

 * Use UP/DOWN keys to navigate between the options.
 * Use LEFT/RIGHT keys to navigate between the CLUES/SUSPECTS window.
 * You will be given with certain number of tokens before the start of each level.
   A set of options will be there to help you to solve the case.
   Each option costs you token(s).
 * The number against each clue represents the number of tokens you have to spend for that level.
 * You will get more clues and suspects as you keep playing.
 * Depending on how fast you finish a case, you earn XPs.
 * Retrying a level again WON't increase your XP/tokens.
 * Once you start a level, you CANNOT quit that level before completing it!

I 'll be there to help you out all the time, so no worries!

And sssh, you can use the remaining tokens for the next levels!

You will learn more as you progress!


Now let's go to Level 1! Good luck!
